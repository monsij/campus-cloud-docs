## AWS Networking Architecture

Introduction

Start with a basic understanding of [AWS networking and VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) concepts.

The Campus Landing Zone provides a set of functionality


  *   Visibility for the Network Operations Group for traffic through the transit gateway and to collect and view VPC Flow Logs from individual sub accounts.

  *   VPN Connectivity back to the Campus Network.

  *   Inter Account connectivity and NAT Gateway access for private subnets using the transit gateway.

AWS Production Landing Zone
RFC 1918 Allocation
10.226.0.0/16 (us-west-2)
10.227.0.0/16 (us-east-1)

Campus-side VPN Endpoints (us-west-2)
128.111.38.197

You will need to allow traffic from the subnets allocated to your VPC, but the larger ranges are specified above.

Transit Gateway
The [AWS Transit Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html) is the networking hub for the organization.  Each VPC in a child account has one Transit Gateway Attachment allowing traffic to route between VPCs.  The Transit Gateway also provides routes for private subnets in child accounts to reach UCSB (via a VPN) or the general internet (via NAT).  Transit Gateways are region-wide assets.

Campus VPN Connection
The [AWS Site-to-Site VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) connection to UCSB is attached to the Transit Gateway.  This link is the default route for traffic from any private subnet on a child account to UCSB.  Note: Resources on public subnets route to UCSB over their own internet gateway.
